# ðŸŽ¬ My Portfolio

This is my **personal portfolio** â€” a mix of code, caffeine, and the occasional existential crisis.  
Live Demo ðŸ‘‰ [Click Here](https://jayavardhantummala.github.io/Portfolio/)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **HTML5** â€“ the bones  
- **CSS3** â€“ the drip ðŸ’…  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â€“ the brain ðŸ§   

## ðŸŽ¨ Features
- Smooth transitions and animations (because static pages are so 2005).  
- Responsive design that looks just as good on your phone as it does on your giant desktop monitor.  
- Sections that *slide*, *fade*, and *pop* like theyâ€™ve had three cups of coffee.

## ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact
Youâ€™d think making animations with JS is easy â€”  
Until you spend **3 hours** making something move 20px smoother.  
Trust me, thereâ€™s more *trial and error* here than in my college lab experiments.
